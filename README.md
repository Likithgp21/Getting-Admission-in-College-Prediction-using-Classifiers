**Getting Admission in College Prediction Using Machine Learning**

Overview

The "Getting Admission in College Prediction" project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict a student's chance of getting admitted into a college based on various features such as GRE Score, TOEFL Score, University Rating, SOP (Statement of Purpose), LOR (Letter of Recommendation), CGPA, and Research Experience. This model helps students assess their chances of admission based on their profile, offering them valuable insights for decision-making.

Features
•	Input Parameters:
1.	GRE Score: Graduate Record Examinations score.
2.	TOEFL Score: Test of English as a Foreign Language score.
3.	University Rating: Rating of the university based on quality.
4.	SOP: Statement of Purpose (score).
5.	LOR: Letter of Recommendation strength (score).
6.	CGPA: Cumulative Grade Point Average.
7.	Research: Research experience (binary: 0 = no, 1 = yes).
•	Output:
1.	Chance of Admission: A percentage probability of getting into a college (e.g., "Chance of getting into UCLA is 92.855%").
•	Machine Learning Model:
1.	Uses machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression or Random Forest Regressor to predict the probability of admission.
